Feature planned for introduction

- bits_events, an extension of bits_status that signals with a different
  color the time periods in which there surely are people at the poul
  (e.g: riunione poul)

- urgent messages, possibility to tag a message as "urgent" and this will
  cause a sound to be played when the message is received
